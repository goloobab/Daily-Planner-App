# Daily-Planner-App

## Description 

This project is a Daily planner written and developed using in Javascript JQuery. The user of this quiz/application will be presented with a start page witha start button. When the Start Quiz button is pressed the questions will start to display on the screen and the 60 seconds timer will starta  count down. A correct answer earns you a mark while a wron one deducts 10 second from the count down. The quiz ends when the time is up or when all the question are completed. Different players take this quiz and their different scores will be recorded together with their initials.  This is part of my learning journey  towards web development.

## Task
Creating  a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

Acceptance Criteria:

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
* Persist events between refreshes of a page.


## Challenges

* Determing the data type to use for questions. 
* saving the users input with scores.
* Accessing saved records from the local storage.
* Returning the arrays in a sorted format.

## Things I learned 
* How useful it is to break down code using functions
* Using API's in Vanilla javascript.
* Havng different javascript files pointing to the same html.
* Making pages interactive with event listeners.
* Storing data on the client side using the local storage.
